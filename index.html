<p class="lead conceal">We are Conundrum. A Draenor based horde guild who are actively recruiting for World of Warcraft: Shadowlands. Our history goes back into the end of Warlords of Draenor on the Genjuros server, where a new guild called Drifters would emerge to conquer all content that Legion had to offer. After clearing the first two raids and taking a brake, Drifters got reorganized into Infinitus, this time changing realm to the Defias Brotherhood RP server due to a lack of population on our home realm. Infinitus is where most of the current members would meet each other and raid, build friendships and even met each other outside of the game as part of annualy held guild meet-ups. Battle for Azeroth would bring us a new chapter in our lives, in which we had to transfer realms again for the same reason and because the guild wanted to be so much more. We eventually switched realms to Draenor in an attempt to find new, like minded players and because the ambitions of the guild had grown.  </p> 
<h1 class="head1 conceal">Who we are</h1>       
<p class="lead conceal">Here it was where we cleared the first raids in Battle for Azeroth, teamed up for awesome mythic plus content and even killed a few bosses in Mythic raiding. For the first time in our history we are going for Cutting Edge each tier and as such, we are looking for players who know that World of Warcraft is about community. Players who have heard about some guilds meeting up, year after year, and think that forming such a friendship is something they want. We are looking for players who want to put in the effort for themselves, but more so for their brothers in arms in game and friends in real life. If you are looking for a guild to make friends in, raid high end content, do high end mythic plus but also get to meet new friends along the way, consider joining!</p>
  <div class="mobileHide s1mobile"><p class="mobilep">We are Conundrum. A Draenor based horde guild who are actively recruiting for World of Warcraft: Shadowlands. We are a group of friends who first met in game and then irl who are looking for like minded players to team up, kill mythic bosses and maybe even make new friends along the way. Our guild was first created four years ago under the name of Drifters on the Genjuros server. After that we migrated to Defias Brotherhood RP server and rebranded ourselves as Infinitus. Our core members didn't know this yet, but this is where they would first meet and the first friendships would be formed. After spending most of Legion there, we migrated yet again to Draenor, this time calling ourselves Conundrum, and we've been here ever since. While clearing HC and Mythic content we have had our ups and downs but the core group as always stayed together. We want to find more people that share our vision and that hopefully want to integrate into our happy little bunch. Hope to see you in discord soon! </p></div>

<section class="section s3">
      <p class="lead conceal">We are very grateful for the journey that brought us here but even more so, we are excited to see what lies ahead. Most of us have played this game since day one and we, just like you, have noticed that most guilds only have one focus. If they are doing too well in the raiding scene they probably aren't very friendly. If they are too friendly then that's a tell tale sign that their raiding team is no more than a glorified social guild. We have had our fair share of drama with this aswell. People are very different, some wanna raid mythic, others want to raid heroic, some opt to raid either mythic or heroic but not put in the effort for either of them relying on their guild mates to pick up their role in a fight.</p>
    <h1 class="head2 conceal">Our Goal</h1>   
    <p class="lead conceal">In Shadowlands our vision is to create a guild that is truly capable of offering everything people log into the game for. Want to raid mythic? Sure, we raid 2-3 times a week and we would love to see you there! Want to raid Heroic content? That's great, join our HC only team and have fun! Want to do pet battles, fishing, PvP or any other activity the game has to offer? Awesome! We have a rank just for you so that it's easier to find guild members who share your same passions. All this cannot be accomplished without players and without the right mentality. If you are the type of person who knows that in order to get ahead you have to put in the work, you might be the person we're looking for. If you are willing to put in the effort for every activity you want to do then we would like to meet you. Help us create a one of a kind guild and be a part of our story.</p>
   <div class="mobileHide s1mobile"><p class="mobilep">We've never really focused on a set goal within the game, just raided until it wasn't fun anymore or pushed high Mythic+, not because of the Raider.io score or bragging rights but because we were having fun together. No we want to keep that atmosphere while also being determined to achieve more this time around. Our goal for Shadowlands is to get Cutting Edge each raid tier. This is where you come in, dear player, join our ranks, become our friend and help us kill bosses. We don't want just names appearing online and offline again, we are looking for meaningfull relationships with everyone we choose to be at our side so our recruitment methods are adapted to that end. We take into account raiding skills and experience, your type of humor, how active you are on discord and in the game and most important of all: your attitude. </p></div>

      <div class="row conceal"><div class="col-md-6 management topRow"><img src="assets/Alex%20IMG.jpg" class="officer"><h5>Willow started playing World of Warcraft when he was 15 years old. He started out in the raiding scene with Karazhan, Mount Hyjal and Black Temple. He loved it but at his heart he was drawn towards PvP more than anything else. This started a on again, off again relationship with the game because for PvP you don't care about what raid patch you're in. You just come back, gear up and have fun in arenas or battlegrounds. That stopped in Warlords of Draenor when he made his own own guild. He started off with Drifters, after that in Legion came Infinitus, and then he finally created <strong>Conundrum</strong>. Along the way he met the people that would become his best friends and his inspiration for keeping things going, organizing in game/irl events and generally trying to keep everyone from killing each other.</h5></div><div class="col-md-6 management topRow conceal"><img src="assets/Peeka%20IMG%20final.jpg" class="officer"><h5>Peekaboe started playing WoW in late 2005. His first character was a orc warrior which he mained for tanking. After some time spent getting the hang of the game and raiding Molten Core and Zul'gurub the next new expansion would bring him a new perspective on the game. He started raiding Karazhan and PvPing so the search started for a proper guild in which to do content. In Wrath of the Lich he found the guild he was looking for and started gaining the experience that would actually end up making him an officer within Conundrum. The only expansion he has not played is Mists of Pandaria and nowadays he's extatic to play Shadowlands for the social aspect and content that WoW has. Drop him a line whenever you need a chill and awesome guy to hang with.</h5></div></div>

  <div class="row conceal"><div class="col-md-6 management bottomRow"><img src="assets/Sebii.jpg" class="officer"><h5>Sebi is a World of Warcraft veteran. He started playing in vanilla. Even though most of the time played was on unofficial servers, he gave retail WoW a shot at the end of Warlords of Draenor and he is still salty about not completing the Gold Challenge Mode since he was too fresh for that. Some of the more notable achievements so far include being a shaman class leader in vanilla (healer spec), pushing for the Burning Crusade raid attunements (including raiding) and fast forward to Legion going for the Mage Tower challenges. Being more of a independent player post-TBC he wants to come back to the social aspect of the game and contribute to the best of his ability towards a nice community and push those M+ keys and Mythic Raids. He is a very chill guy who loves to lend a helping hand whenever needed.</h5></div><div class="col-md-6 management bottomRow"><img src="assets/The%20final%20ozzy.jpg" class="officer"><h5>Ozzy started playing the game in late Burning Crusade, casually on and off, mainly interested in PvE but didn't mind doing the casual PvP match here and there. He maintained his casual aproach to the game playing all expansions apart from Mists of Pandaria. He met Willow at the end of Legion when the guild was doing casual Heroic raids getting ready for Battle for Azeroth. That was the point where he developed a passion for raiding and took his approach and skills to the next level. After that he decided to get more involved in the game, actively helping other guild members and even becoming an officer of Conundrum in the process. Now he is really excited for Shadowlands, all the new content, the social aspects it will bring and for leading the guild with the rest of management.</h5></div></div>

    <div class="slide">
    <div class="faq"><h2>Q : How do you guys sort BoE's?</h2><p>You are free to keep your BoE. We use RC loot council if you have a tradeable item that you don't need. In that case management decides which player gets it based on a number of factors.</p></div>

      <div class="faq"><h2>Q : What type of content do you guys normally do?</h2><p>For Shadowlands we will be mainly a raiding guild with the goal of Cutting Edge for each tier.
