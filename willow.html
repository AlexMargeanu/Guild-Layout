  <div class="col-md-6 management topRow"><img src="assets/Alex%20IMG.jpg" class="officer"><h5>Willow started playing World of Warcraft when he was 15 years old. He started out in the raiding scene with Karazhan, Mount Hyjal and Black Temple. He loved it but at his heart he was drawn towards PvP more than anything else. This started a on again, off again relationship with the game because for PvP you don't care about what raid patch you're in. You just come back, gear up and have fun in arenas or battlegrounds. That stopped in Warlords of Draenor when he was set on making his own guild. He started off with Drifters, after that in Legion came Infinitus, and then he finally created <strong>Conundrum</strong>. Along the way he met the people that would become his best friends and his inspiration for keeping things going, organizing in game/irl events and generally trying to keep everyone from killing each other.</h5></div>
