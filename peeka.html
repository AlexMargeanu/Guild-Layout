  <div class="col-md-6 management topRow"><img src="assets/Peeka%20IMG%20final.jpg" class="officer"><h5>Peekaboe started playing WoW in late 2005. His first character was a orc warrior which he mained for tanking. After some time spent getting the hang of the game and raiding Molten Core and Zul'gurub the next new expansion would bring him a new perspective on the game. He started raiding Karazhan and PvPing so the search started for a proper guild in which to do content. In Wrath of the Lich he found the guild he was looking for and started gaining the experience that would actually end up making him an officer within Conundrum. The only expansion he has not played is Mists of Pandaria and nowadays he's extatic to play Shadowlands for the social aspect and content that WoW has. Drop him a line whenever you need a chill and awesome guy to hang with.</h5></div>
