  <div class="col-md-6 management topRow"><img src="assets/final%20ozzy.jpg" class="officer"><h5>Ozzy started playing the game in late Burning Crusade, casually on and off, mainly interested in PvE but didn't mind doing the casual PvP match here and there. He maintained his casual aproach to the game playing all expansions apart from Mists of Pandaria. He met Willow at the end of Legion when the guild was doing casual Heroic raids getting ready for Battle for Azeroth. That was the point where he developed a passion for raiding and took his approach and skills to the next level. After that he decided to get more involved in the game, actively helping other guild members and even becoming an officer of Conundrum in the process. Now he is really excited for Shadowlands, all the new content, the social aspects it will bring and for leading the guild with the rest of management.</h5></div>
